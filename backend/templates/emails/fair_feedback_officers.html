    <h2>[IMPORTANT] SAC Fair Feedback & Information</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    	Hi there!
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">
        Hope you had a great SAC Fair! As a club officer, we would love to hear your feedback on the 
        transition to Penn Clubs this summer and any comments you have about the SAC Fair.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">
        We also wanted to remind you to take advantage of your "Subscriptions" list — a feature that
        Penn Clubs has put together for users to easily be added to your listserv. It is <b>imperative</b>
        that if you have an application, info session, or additional information, that you reach out 
        to these prospective students. You can access your club's Subscriptions list by clicking <a href="{{ subscriptions_url }}">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    Thanks for helping us expand our platform during the SAC Fair! We appreciate your patience as we
     transitioned. Please let us know if you have any questions or feedback.
    </p>
