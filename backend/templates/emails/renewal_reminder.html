<h2>Reminder to Renew <b>{{ name }}</b> on Penn Clubs & SAC Fair Signup by 8/24!</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    Dear <b>{{ name }}</b> leaders,
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #8B2222">
    You are receiving this notification because you were the contact for your organization during the 2019 SAC
    Activities Fair. You have not yet renewed your club for the {{ year }} school year. If you do not submit a renewal
    request by August
    24th, your club may not appear on the Penn Clubs website in time for new student orientation. Use the green button
    below
    to renew your club. The process takes less than 5 minutes.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    If you have already graduated, <b>PLEASE FORWARD THIS EMAIL</b> to the current leadership of
    the group so that they may complete the registration process and sign up for the SAC Fair. If
    they are not currently listed as an officer for your club on Penn Clubs, they will need to
    email <b>contact@pennclubs.com</b> with their <b>name, PennKey, and club name</b>.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    We have opened the student group registration process for the 2020-2021 academic year. To be
    considered an active student group on campus, the University requires all student organizations
    to be registered with and approved by the Office of Student Affairs. <b>This year, OSA has migrated the Student
        Groups platform from the previous system, G.O. Penn, to Penn Labs' platform, Penn Clubs.</b>
    All official registry of student groups, including the annual student group registration process, will now be
    handled
    through Penn Clubs.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    Additionally, the Student Activities Council (SAC) is partnering with Penn Clubs to host a
    virtual multiday Activities Fair from <b>Sep 1 – 3</b>. More details on the Fair will be shared at a
    later date by SAC. To participate in the Fair, you must be a student-run club at the
    University of Pennsylvania approved by the OSA. Registration through the Penn Clubs portal will require PennKey
    authentication.
    The deadline to sign up for the SAC Fair is <b>August 24th</b>.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    Once the request for registration is approved, the group will be listed on the
    front page of Penn Clubs and will be searchable for students on the site.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Since this information is being distributed through various listservs and methods, please
    communicate
    with your entire executive board before signing up for the fair. <b>ONLY ONE</b> officer of the club
    should be designated to register the group.

</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    <u><b>Re-Registration Process (including SAC Fair sign-up) - Deadline Aug. 24th</b></u>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    Again, it is imperative that your group designate <b>ONLY ONE</b> executive board member to complete this process,
    preferably a
    member who is listed on pennclubs.com as an officer for your club.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
