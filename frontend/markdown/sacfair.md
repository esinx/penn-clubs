# Penn Clubs: SAC Fair Guide

Hi there! üéâ

Welcome to **Penn Clubs**, the University of Pennsylvania's official registry for student organizations on campus. The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the many different features that Penn Clubs can offer that will make your experience recruiting new members as easy as possible.

## üìÖ REQUIRED: Editing Your SAC Fair "Booth"

You will need to add a Zoom link to your club's SAC Fair event. Once you navigate to your club on [pennclubs.com](http://pennclubs.com), click the green "Manage Club" button on the top-right corner of the page. If you do not see this button, it means you are not an officer of the club. Either ask an officer listed on your club to add you to the page, or email contact@pennclubs.com with your Penn email and club name to be added as an officer.

Click the "Events" tab:

There will be an existing event with your designated date & time titled "SAC Fair Info Session". Click "Edit".

Edit the club details: you MUST provide a Zoom link (preferably from your school Zoom account) where prospective students can navigate to for your info session. Here, you can also:
- Add a description
- Add a cover photo (16:9 dimensiions)

**Be sure to hit the green "save" button on the lefthand side when you are done!**

**And that's it!** Your club's event will show up in the portal during the live, virtual SAC Fair on the day you were assigned.

## üì∑ Zoom Best Practices

To get all possible features, please use an account using the school's licensed Zoom accounts. You should have received an email from your home school about obtaining login credentials for this.

Schedule a new meeting, using the given **date and time** as outlined in the e-mail given to you by SAC with these settings:

- A required meeting password
- Under Advanced Options:
    - Waiting room **disabled**
    - **Mute participants upon entry enabled**
    - **Only authenticated users can join enabled**

When hosting your event:

- Make all present members of the session **co-hosts** to help control the session.
- Have the chat window **open** to answer any questions. For busier sessions, we recommend designating one member to be monitoring the chat window.
- For busier sessions where multiple club members are present, we recommend taking advantage of the **breakout room** feature, which can be prompted by hosts. We would suggest **manually assigning** people to a breakout room, to ensure a member of the club is there to answer questions.
- <important>Ensure that you setup and test breakout rooms before the SAC fair starts by using! If you do not setup breakout rooms beforehand, you will not be able to use them during the meeting.</important> See [this guide](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476093-Enabling-breakout-rooms) on how to set up breakout rooms.

## üìé Recruitment Resources

Tired of creating a Google Form to track all interested members? Now, students can click the "Subscribe" bell button on your club's page to immediately be added to your club's own interest list without spending the time to fill out a form. By hitting the "Subscribe" bell button, interested members will have their name and email added to your interest list.

![Subscribe Button](6.png)

To access this interest list, simply navigate to "Manage Club" once again, then to the "Recruitment" tab. You will see a table of members who have subscribed to your club. You can scroll to the bottom to download an Excel file of all these members' names, emails, and more self-reported information.

## ‚ùìClub Q&A

To allow interested students to ask questions about your club at any time, we also have an FAQ section on each club's page. When students post a question, all club officers will receive an email notification that a question has been asked. 

![Club FAQ](8.png)

To answer the questions, navigate once again to the "Manage Club", and then to the "Questions" tab, where you can see all questions asked and answer or delete them. You can also choose to hide or show a question on your club's profile once it has been answered.

## üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Managing Members

As you can tell, there is a lot of responsibility for club owners already. To help lessen the load, you can invite other officers of your club to join your club's profile. Click the "Manage Club" button once again, and then navigate to the "Membership" tab. By entering email addresses (separated by commas or newlines) you can send invites to all the officers of your club by clicking the "Officer" status under Permissions. You can do the same with non-officer members, but leaving their status as "Member". **Only Officers and Owners of a club can use the Manage Club button**.
