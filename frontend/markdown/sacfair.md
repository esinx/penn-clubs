Hi there! üéâ

Welcome to **Penn Clubs**, the University of Pennsylvania's official registry for student organizations on campus. The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the many different features that Penn Clubs can offer that will make your experience recruiting new members as easy as possible.

## üìÖ REQUIRED: Editing Your SAC Fair "Booth"

You will need to add a Zoom link to your club's SAC Fair event. Once you navigate to your club on [pennclubs.com](http://pennclubs.com), click the green "Manage Club" button on the top-right corner of the page. If you do not see this button, it means you are not an officer of the club. Either ask an officer listed on your club to add you to the page, or email contact@pennclubs.com with your Penn email and club name to be added as an officer.

Click the "Events" tab:

![Events Tab](2.png)

There will be an existing event with your designated date & time titled "SAC Fair Info Session". Click "Edit".

![Edit SAC Fair Event](3.png)

Edit the club details: you **MUST provide a Zoom link** (preferably from your school Zoom account, see details below for best practices for setting up your scheduled Zoom meeting) where prospective students can navigate to for your info session. Here, you can also:
- Add a description
- Add a cover photo (16:9 dimensions, preferably 1920 x 1080)

We recommend that you fill out as many details as possible. Students will be shown currently occuring events in completely random order, with one exception. Clubs that have fully entered their event information will appear above clubs who have not.

Note that this date is **fixed**. Trying to change the date and time will result in an error, preventing you from saving your details. If you have any questions about the date, please email sac@sacfunded.net.

**Be sure to hit the green "save" button on the lefthand side when you are done!**

Finally, check that you have the best settings for your Zoom meeting with [this tool](/zoom).

**And that's it!** Your club's event will show up in the portal during the live, virtual SAC Fair on the day you are assigned.

## üì∏ Zoom Best Practices: Automated

To get all possible features on Zoom, please use the school's licensed Zoom accounts. To help you get set up, we encourage you to use our automated system [here](/zoom), which is a quick, three-step process that will make sure your settings for meetings are configured correctly for the SAC Fair. If you would like to configure your settings manually, follow the steps in the section below.

<a href="/zoom" class="button is-success">Start Setup</a>

## üì∑ Zoom Best Practices: Manual

If the automated process above doesn't work for you, you can configure your Zoom room manually using the instructions below. You should have received an email from your home school about obtaining login credentials for your Zoom account. To login to Zoom, you want to select "Sign in with SSO" instead of entering an email and password. The company domain that you should use for the next step is **upenn**. After choosing the company domain, you will be redirected to the PennKey login page.

Enable breakout rooms for your meetings. See [this guide](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476093-Enabling-breakout-rooms) on how to set up breakout rooms. Then, schedule a new meeting, using the given **date and time** as outlined in the e-mail given to you by SAC. You can also see your time slot [here](/fair). Use the following settings:

- A required meeting password
- Under Advanced Options:
    - Waiting room ‚Äì **disabled**
    - Mute participants upon entry - **enabled**
    - [Only authenticated users can join](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360037117472-Authentication-Profiles-for-meetings-and-webinars) - **enabled**
- <important>Ensure that you setup and test breakout rooms before the SAC fair starts! If you do not setup breakout rooms beforehand, you will not be able to use them during the meeting.</important> We recommend getting familiar with breakout rooms before the fair starts, as the behavior may not be what you expect. While using breakout rooms, ensure that you still have an officer in the main room in case anyone comes in.

## üé§ Hosting Your Zoom Event
- If you use a personal account, the maximum number of people that can attend your meeting at once is **100 people**. If you use the school provided account, this limit increases to **300 people**. You can check the meeting limit for you account on the Zoom settings page.
- Make all present members of the session **co-hosts** to help control the session.
- Have the chat window **open** to answer any questions. For busier sessions, we recommend designating one member to be monitoring the chat window.
- For busier sessions where multiple club members are present, we recommend taking advantage of the **breakout room** feature, which can be prompted by hosts. Breakout rooms can be used to facilitate 1 on 1 conversations with club members and fair attendees. We would suggest **manually assigning** people to a breakout room, to ensure a member of the club is there to answer questions.

## üé• Recording Part of Your Session

If you are planning to use a short pitch or short presentation to share with prospective students, we encourage you to record a small partof your Zoom session so that students, especially those with time zone conflicts, can access the recording again. You will be able to link the video recording on your club page after the fair. If you choose to do this, please keep in mind:
- You should aim to record one presentation/description of your club that is no longer than a few minutes.
- Before recording, you must announce aloud at the start of the session that the presentation portion will be recorded for content purposes and allow students to decide if they wish to stay off-camera until the recording is complete. Once the record button is selected, all participants will receive a consent pop up message prompting them to stay in or leave the meeting during the recording.
- No other virtual session portions should be recorded, including chats, Q & A, or other activities (i.e. icebreakers, etc.) that may occur during sessions.

To do this, a host of the session can simply just hit the record button. To easily link the file on your club page later, we recommend you click on the "Record to the Cloud" option.

## üìé Recruitment Resources

Tired of creating a Google Form to track all interested members? Now, students can click the "Subscribe" bell button on your club's page to immediately be added to your club's own interest list without spending the time to fill out a form. By hitting the "Subscribe" bell button, interested members will have their name and email added to your interest list. You will receive the following information about each subscriber:
- Name
- Email
- Graduation Year
- School(s)
- Major(s)

![Subscribe Button](6.png)

To access this interest list, simply navigate to "Manage Club" once again, then to the "Recruitment" tab. You will see a table of members who have subscribed to your club. You can scroll to the bottom to download an Excel file of all these members' names, emails, and more self-reported information.

![Interest List](7.png)

## ‚ùìClub Q&A

To allow interested students to ask questions about your club at any time, we also have an FAQ section on each club's page. When students post a question, all club officers will receive an email notification that a question has been asked. 

![Club FAQ](8.png)

To answer the questions, navigate once again to the "Manage Club", and then to the "Questions" tab, where you can see all questions asked and answer or delete them. You can also choose to hide or show a question on your club's profile once it has been answered.

![Answering Questions for Clubs](9.png)

## üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Managing Members

As you can tell, there is a lot of responsibility for club owners already. To help lessen the load, you can invite other officers of your club to join your club's profile. Click the "Manage Club" button once again, and then navigate to the "Membership" tab. By entering email addresses (separated by commas or newlines) you can send invites to all the officers of your club by clicking the "Officer" status under Permissions. You can do the same with non-officer members, but leaving their status as "Member". **Only Officers and Owners of a club have access to the Manage Club button**.
