Hi there! üéâ

Welcome to **Penn Clubs**, the University of Pennsylvania's official registry for student organizations on campus. The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the many different features that Penn Clubs can offer that will make your experience recruiting new members as easy as possible.

<div class="has-text-danger">Club officers will <b>not</b> be able to access the list of students that have bookmarked their club. Bookmarks are intended for personal use only. If you would like a student to send you their contact information, ensure that they <b>subscribe</b> to your club instead of bookmarking it.</div>

## üìÖ REQUIRED: Editing Your Activites Fair Booth

To help you get set up, use our automated system by clicking the button below. This is a quick, three-step process that will make sure your meetings are configured correctly for the upcoming fair.

The final step of the setup process will ask you to add a description and cover photo to your event. You can do this by clicking on the "Edit Event" button.

![Edit Activites Fair Event](3.png)

You will need to change the following fields:

- Add a description
- Add a cover photo (16:9 dimensions, preferably 1920 x 1080)

We recommend that you fill out as many details as possible. Students will be shown currently occuring events in completely random order, with one exception. Clubs that have fully entered their event information will appear above clubs who have not.

Note that this date is **fixed**. Trying to change the date and time will result in an error, preventing you from saving your details. If you have any questions about the date, please email the event organizers.

**Be sure to hit the green "save" button on the lefthand side when you are done!**

**And that's it!** Your club's event will show up in the portal during the live activites fair on the day you are assigned.

## üìé Recruitment Resources

Tired of creating a Google Form to track all interested members? Now, students can click the "Subscribe" bell button on your club's page to immediately be added to your club's own interest list without spending the time to fill out a form. By hitting the "Subscribe" bell button, interested members will have their name and email added to your interest list. You will receive the following information about each subscriber:

- Name
- Email
- Graduation Year
- School(s)
- Major(s)

![Subscribe Button](6.png)

To access this interest list, simply navigate to "Manage Club" once again, then to the "Recruitment" tab. You will see a table of members who have subscribed to your club. You can scroll to the bottom to download an Excel file of all these members' names, emails, and more self-reported information.

## ‚ùìClub Q&A

To allow interested students to ask questions about your club at any time, we also have an FAQ section on each club's page. When students post a question, all club officers will receive an email notification that a question has been asked.

![Club FAQ](8.png)

To answer the questions, navigate once again to the "Manage Club", and then to the "Questions" tab, where you can see all questions asked and answer or delete them. You can also choose to hide or show a question on your club's profile once it has been answered.

## üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Managing Members

As you can tell, there is a lot of responsibility for club owners already. To help lessen the load, you can invite other officers of your club to join your club's profile. Click the "Manage Club" button once again, and then navigate to the "Membership" tab. By entering email addresses (separated by commas or newlines) you can send invites to all the officers of your club by clicking the "Officer" status under Permissions. You can do the same with non-officer members, but leaving their status as "Member". **Only Officers and Owners of a club have access to the Manage Club button**.
