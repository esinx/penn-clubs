Hi there! üéâ

Welcome to **Penn Clubs**, the University of Pennsylvania's official registry for student organizations on campus. The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the many different features that Penn Clubs can offer that will make your experience recruiting new members as easy as possible.

<div class="has-text-danger">Club officers will <b>not</b> be able to access the list of students that have bookmarked their club. Bookmarks are intended for personal use only. If you would like a student to send you their contact information, ensure that they <b>subscribe</b> to your club instead of bookmarking it.</div>

## üìÖ REQUIRED: Editing Your Activites Fair Booth

To help you get set up, use our automated system by clicking the button below. This is a quick, three-step process that will make sure your meetings are configured correctly for the upcoming fair.

<a href="/zoom" class="button is-success">Start Setup</a>

The final step of the setup process will ask you to add a description and cover photo to your event. You can do this by clicking on the "Edit Event" button.

![Edit Virtual Activites Fair Event](3.png)

You will need to change the following fields:

- Add a description
- Add a cover photo (16:9 dimensions, preferably 1920 x 1080)

We recommend that you fill out as many details as possible. Students will be shown currently occuring events in completely random order, with one exception. Clubs that have fully entered their event information will appear above clubs who have not.

Note that this date is **fixed**. Trying to change the date and time will result in an error, preventing you from saving your details. If you have any questions about the date, please email the event organizers.

**Be sure to hit the green "save" button on the lefthand side when you are done!**

**And that's it!** Your club's event will show up in the portal during the live, virtual activites fair on the day you are assigned.

## üé§ Hosting Your Zoom Event

- If you use a personal account, the maximum number of people that can attend your meeting at once is **100 people**. If you use the school provided account, this limit increases to **300 people**. You can check the meeting limit for you account on the Zoom settings page.
- Make all present members of the session **co-hosts** to help control the session.
- Have the chat window **open** to answer any questions. For busier sessions, we recommend designating one member to be monitoring the chat window.

## üé• Recording Part of Your Session

If you are planning to use a short pitch or short presentation to share with prospective students, we encourage you to record a small partof your Zoom session so that students, especially those with time zone conflicts, can access the recording again. You will be able to link the video recording on your club page after the fair. If you choose to do this, please keep in mind:

- You should aim to record one presentation/description of your club that is no longer than a few minutes.
- Before recording, you must announce aloud at the start of the session that the presentation portion will be recorded for content purposes and allow students to decide if they wish to stay off-camera until the recording is complete. Once the record button is selected, all participants will receive a consent pop up message prompting them to stay in or leave the meeting during the recording.
- No other virtual session portions should be recorded, including chats, Q & A, or other activities (i.e. icebreakers, etc.) that may occur during sessions.

To do this, a host of the session can simply just hit the record button. To easily link the file on your club page later, we recommend you click on the "Record to the Cloud" option.

## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Managing Breakout Rooms

For busier sessions where multiple club members are present, we recommend taking advantage of the **breakout room** feature, which can be prompted by hosts. Breakout rooms can be used to facilitate 1 on 1 conversations with club members and fair attendees. We would suggest **manually assigning** people to a breakout room, to ensure a member of the club is in each breakout room to answer questions.

![Assign Breakout Rooms Manually](Breakout1.png)

Once you choose the number of rooms, you can manually assign participants to each room. Just click the "Assign" button and select the active participants you would like to move into each breakout room.

![Assign Breakout Rooms Manually](Breakout4.png)

Hosts and co-hosts can move around to breakout rooms freely, though regular participants must join the room they are assigned. As a host, you must regularly be watching the Breakout Rooms window, as new participants will not be put in a breakout room initially. You will have to assign them manually, by clicking the "Assign to" button next to their name when they join. They will be listed under the "Unassigned" attendees.

![Assign Breakout Rooms to New Participants](Breakout3.png)

You can also broadcast messages to all of the participants in the breakout by using the "Broadcast message to all" button.

## üìé Recruitment Resources

Tired of creating a Google Form to track all interested members? Now, students can click the "Subscribe" bell button on your club's page to immediately be added to your club's own interest list without spending the time to fill out a form. By hitting the "Subscribe" bell button, interested members will have their name and email added to your interest list. You will receive the following information about each subscriber:

- Name
- Email
- Graduation Year
- School(s)
- Major(s)

![Subscribe Button](6.png)

To access this interest list, simply navigate to "Manage Club" once again, then to the "Recruitment" tab. You will see a table of members who have subscribed to your club. You can scroll to the bottom to download an Excel file of all these members' names, emails, and more self-reported information.

![Interest List](7.png)

## ‚ùìClub Q&A

To allow interested students to ask questions about your club at any time, we also have an FAQ section on each club's page. When students post a question, all club officers will receive an email notification that a question has been asked.

![Club FAQ](8.png)

To answer the questions, navigate once again to the "Manage Club", and then to the "Questions" tab, where you can see all questions asked and answer or delete them. You can also choose to hide or show a question on your club's profile once it has been answered.

## üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Managing Members

As you can tell, there is a lot of responsibility for club owners already. To help lessen the load, you can invite other officers of your club to join your club's profile. Click the "Manage Club" button once again, and then navigate to the "Membership" tab. By entering email addresses (separated by commas or newlines) you can send invites to all the officers of your club by clicking the "Officer" status under Permissions. You can do the same with non-officer members, but leaving their status as "Member". **Only Officers and Owners of a club have access to the Manage Club button**.
