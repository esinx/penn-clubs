          <b>Hi there! Welcome to Penn Clubs!</b> We are the official platform
          for student organizations on campus, and we are excited to get you
          connected to clubs on our platform this year. In collaboration with
          the {fairInfo.organization}, we will be hosting the virtual club fair
          this fall. Below is some important information that will set you up
          for a successful experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How the {fairInfo.name} will be run:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The {fairInfo.name} will be held on <b>{fairInfo.time}</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The main fair functionality is each club's informational Zoom
            meeting, which will all be visible on our{' '}
            {isFairOpen ? (
              <a href="https://pennclubs.com/events">Live Events Page</a>
            ) : (
              'Live Events Page'
            )}
            . Representatives of each club will be available in these meetings
            to answer questions, give short presentations, and otherwise
            interact with students.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also visit each club's individual page. Each club's page has
            a description, contact information, and a FAQ feature that club
            officers will be monitoring throughout the fair that you can use to
            ask questions. Questions can be submitted anonymously.
          </li>
          <li>
            To keep track of clubs you are interested in, we encourage you to
            use some of the tools on our platform!

          <b>Code of Conduct:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Please be respectful in attending information sessions. If the
            session is busy with many attendees, allow each other to take turns
            asking questions. Where appropriate, use the 'raise hand' feature to
            reduce interruptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please use appropriate language in the chat windows on Zoom. There
            will be peer to peer monitoring, ensuring that student participants
            and club members are not misusing any features during these
            sessions.
